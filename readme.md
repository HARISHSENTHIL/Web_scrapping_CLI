Project Overview

This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract data from various websites and transform it into formats suitable for training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). It offers three distinct scraping modes:

1. CLI Mode (Python):

Provides a command-line interface for direct interaction and customization.
Offers flexibility for advanced users who prefer manual control.
Returns scraped data in a customizable format.

2. JS Mode (JSON Markdown):

Generates JSON Markdown files, ideal for training and fine-tuning LLMs with real-world data.
Encapsulates extracted data in a structured format for easy ingestion by machine learning models.

3.TS Mode (Markdown):

Focuses solely on extracting body content, providing a streamlined output.
Generates Markdown files suitable for tasks that require only the core textual content.
