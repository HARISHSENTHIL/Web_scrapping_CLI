This Python program provides a user-friendly interface for web scraping tasks. It allows you to:

Scrape a single website: Enter a URL, and the program will extract data like title, anchor tags, images, headings, and paragraphs.
View existing scraped data: The program loads previously scraped websites from a JSON file and displays them in a clear table format using the beautifultable library.
Save scraped data: Extracted data is saved in JSON format with additional metadata (alias name, domain, scraped time, and status).
